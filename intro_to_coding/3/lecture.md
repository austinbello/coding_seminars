# Intro to Coding: Lecture 3

### Goals

* Reinforce object oriented programming
* Understand remote repositories in git
* Understand the process of TDD
* Be able to use regular expressions

### Lecture

* Homework Review: [Mason's solution](mason.rb)
  * Show `attr_reader`
  * Show `attr_writer`
  * Show `.reduce()` (and talk about the other enumerable methods)
* Problem: Given a block of text, find all phone numbers and e-mail addresses in it
  * Regular expressions (Rubular)
  * Example: Did the user just type in a number?
  * `\d`
  * `*`, `+`
  * `\A`, `\z` OR `^`, `$`
  * Example: Does a string contain a person's name?

  * `\s`
  * `\W`, `\D`, `\S`
  * Example: Does a string store an IP address?
  * `()`
  * `[]`
  * `|`
  * `{1, 3}`
  * `.`
  * Literals
* Finally: Does a string contain a phone number?
  * Create a repo, push it up to Github
  * Forking, `git clone`
  * Gems (minitest)
  * TDD
