## Hiring Approach

Test for values, perhaps through behavioral interviewing questions:

* No jerks / be accountable
* Be positive / enjoy the journey
* Stay agile / always innovate
* Think like a customer

Have a few deal breakers, perhaps:

* Can identify problems in example broken code we provide (tests pattern discovery, even if they don't know the language)
* Can turn in a RAT submission - even if incomplete - involving at least one test and more than one commit (tests familiarity with the professional software development cycle)
* Can explain one of his/her code examples to us (tests ability to recall and articulate reasoning)

Provide a set of scales (yeah, another form) for interviewers to fill in.  In advance, plan out reasonable thresholds for junior, mid, senior developers.

Schedule pair programming time (one on one with a real task to complete, in the office setting), lasting more than half an hour.

## Topics to Cover during Onboarding

Although this is a rather lengthy list, it seems reasonable that we as a group make sure that we intentionally cover our bases on these fronts.  One way to approach it is to group these items together in a number of sessions equalling the number of developers at the company and assign one session to each person.  That way the new dev can hear from and get to met everyone.

Ai-specific:

* PR process
* Use of Slack channels
* Pair programming options
* Staging and production environments
* Use of Docker
* Wordsmith components/services

General programming topics:

* TDD
* OOP & best practices
* Blocks/functional programming
* Relational databases and SQL
* Web requests of all flavors (verbs, headers, etc)
* Regex
* Authentication/security

Discipline-specific (secondary goal: sanity check):

* Class architecture
* Gems/packages we're using
* Test suite (& tooling) overview
* Style guide
