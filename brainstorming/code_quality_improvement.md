Reasons problems are introduced:

* Hotfixes and warmfixes
  * They have a higher probability of regression errors
* Large PRs
  * Reviewers are less likely to catch problems
* Tests are suboptimal
  * Too slow
  * Insufficient coverage
  * Not built before bug fixes
* Common problems not identified
  * Developer training/resources?
  * Start with Ivy's "breaking changes" slides

Metrics:

* Number of hotfixes/warmfixes
* Time spent on hotfixes/warmfixes
* Number of bugs reported

Need to:

* Meet with Matt (re: billing and hotfixes)
* Meet with Damon (re: bug counts and measurement)
* Plan out metric gathering and reporting
